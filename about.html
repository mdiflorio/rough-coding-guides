<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    If you are anything like me, you may have gone through programming tutorials 
    and explanations feeling confident until you get to the projects... Where to begin? 
    How do you link all of that together to create a functional 
    project? Well, my goal is to bridge the gap from completing tutorials 
    to finishing projects.
